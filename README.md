# Brain Tumer Detecting Using ML
It is a ML project that implemented with python 

Using the SciKit-Learn (SKLearn) library to train the model with a given data and achieving a score 98 - 99 % accuracy rate and applying 3 different algorithms to make sure there is no error 

The 3 Algorithms used are:-
<ol>
  <li>SVM (SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE)</li>
  <li>LOGISTIC REGRESSION</li>
  <li>KNN (k-nearest neighbors algorithm)</li>
</ol>
